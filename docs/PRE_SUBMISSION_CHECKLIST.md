- [ ] **DELETE /questions/<id>** - Deletes a question
- [ ] **POST /questions** - Creates a new question
- [ ] **POST /questions** - Searches for questions by term
- [ ] **GET /categories/<id>/questions** - Gets questions by category
- [ ] **POST /quizzes** - Plays quiz game with random questions

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Error handlers implemented** using `@app.errorhandler` decorator:
  - [ ] 400 Bad Request handler
  - [ ] 404 Not Found handler
  - [ ] 422 Unprocessable Entity handler
  - [ ] 500 Internal Server Error handler
- [ ] **Error responses formatted as JSON**
- [ ] All error handlers return consistent format

  - [ ] CREATE (POST) operations verified
  - [ ] READ (GET) operations verified
  - [ ] DELETE operations verified

### Test Execution
```bash
cd backend
python test_flaskr.py
```
Expected result: All tests pass ‚úÖ
